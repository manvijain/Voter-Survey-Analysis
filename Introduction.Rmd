## Introduction

This project uses data from the New Zealand Election Survey (Source: Introduction to Probability and Data(Duke University, Coursera)). My goal through it is to find out about interesting insights such as which party is the most highly rated and where do the people think the government should spend more money. I will be using data analysis and visualization libraries of R to achieve my aim.

## Exploration Points

The statements for which I will be doing analysis are as follows:

1. In which sector do people believe the government should out in more money? And does the opinion of people who discuss politics frequently correctly represent the opinion of the masses?

2. Depending on the rating the people give to the parties what is the pattern of the scores for the various parties?

#3. Relationship between X_SingleFav, jmostlike, jpartyvote
